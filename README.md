# thetopside-public
This Repository serves the purpose of displaying the Google Script Code of my private repository "thetopside". This way, anyone can view the code.


## Code.gs
This serves as the main google apps script backend code for this project. it contains a lot of functions that is called from the JavaScript in the various html of the project - Although that is the initial arrangement on Google Apps script, I shall be separating all necessary JavaScript Code into their dedicated .js files. This will aid readability.


## Index.html
Note that the code here is the first page i created for merely email collection. The update.html is the current version used in production. Index.html is merely here for legacy reasons...More like just helping me see how my coding skills have improved.
